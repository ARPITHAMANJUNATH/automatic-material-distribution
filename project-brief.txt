Ration distribution is one of the widely controversial issues that involve corruption and
illegal distribution of the food grains and goods. The illegal activities are like, wrong entry in the
database about the amount of products given to the people, distribution of low quality food grains
than the actual quality provided for poor people. In databases where large amount of data is stored
and accessed by different users and different access labels are need to incorporate the security and
transparency during the different kinds of information extraction according to role based access
labels. The proposed data model is implemented on the different access labels and a cryptographic
security is implemented during data access. After implementation of these security models the
performance of the system is evaluated. Here, proposed an Automatic Ration Materials
Distribution Based on GSM (Global System for Mobile) and RFID (Radio Frequency
Identification) technology instead of ration cards. To get the materials in ration shop one needâ€™s to
show the RFID tag into the RFID reader, then the controller will check the customer codes and the
details of amount in the card. Once the verification is done, materials will get dispatched
automatically depending upon the card type, after receiving materials controller sends the
information to government office and customer through GSM technology.
